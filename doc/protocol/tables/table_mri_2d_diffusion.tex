\midrule 
Series description     & \ac{DTI}\_RL (and \ac{DTI}\_LR for the repeated scan with reverse phase encoding) \\
Plane                  & Straight axial \\
Slice thickness        & 2mm with no gap \\
Number of slices       & $\sim$80 \\
Phase encode direction & R $\gg$ L\\
Matrix                 & 128 $\times$ 128 \\
\ac{FoV}               & 256 $\times$ 256mm \\
Repetition time        & $\sim$10s \\
Echo time              & 80ms \\
Flip angle             & 90deg \\
Slice order            & Interleaved \\
Number of directions   & 32 \\
B-value                & 0 and 1000 \textsuperscript{s}/\textsubscript{mm\textsuperscript{2}}%
                         (B=0 images interleaved throughout if possible in product sequence) \\
Scan time              & $\sim$8min \\
Further explanations   & Subjects should be instructed to remain still throughout the            
                         scan. \ac{DTI} should be acquired in 32 directions, with slices         
                         covering the top of the brain to the base of the cerebellum. Two        
                         sequences with reversed phase encoding direction should be acquired in  
                         full to correct for susceptibility induced distortions.\\
