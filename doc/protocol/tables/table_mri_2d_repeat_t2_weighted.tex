Further explanations   & Patients should be instructed to keep their eyes open throughout the   
                         scan, e.g. by focusing on a point on the mirror or                     
                         scanner. Immediately after the scan, the subject should be checked to  
                         ensure that they have kept their eyes open and have not fallen         
                         asleep. There should be no audio or video presentation during the      
                         scan.\\
