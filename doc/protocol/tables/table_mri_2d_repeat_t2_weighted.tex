Further explanations   		& Patients should be instructed to keep their eyes open throughout the scan, e.g. by focusing on a point on the mirror or scanner. Immediately after the scan, the subject should be checked to ensure that they have kept their eyes open and have not fallen asleep. There should be no audio or video presentation during the scan.\\
