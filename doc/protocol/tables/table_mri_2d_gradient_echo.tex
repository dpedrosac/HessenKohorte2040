Further explanations                              				& Participants should be instructed to keep their eyes open throughout the scan and to focus on a point on the mirror or scanner. Immediately after the scan, participants should be checked to ensure that they have kept their eyes open and have not fallen asleep. No audio or video presentations should be made during the scan. Axial resting state fMRI slices should be positioned along the AC--PC plane, with one slice above the vertex and the remaining slices maximally covering the brain and as much of the cerebellum as possible. The slices should be centred in the axial plane to avoid anterior/posterior aliasing and \ac{TR}, \ac{TE} should not be altered. \\
