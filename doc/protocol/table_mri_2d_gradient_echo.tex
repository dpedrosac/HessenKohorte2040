Further explanations                              				& Please instruct the participant to keep their eyes open during the entire scan. You can instruct them to focus on a point on the mirror or scanner. Check with the participant immediately after the scan to verify they kept their eyes open and did not fall asleep. No audio or video presentation should be made during the scan.Position the axial resting state fMRI slices along the AC-PC plane with care that there is one slice above the vertex, and then cover the rest of the brain and as much of the cerebellum as possible with the remaining slices. The slices should be centered in the axial plane to prevent aliasing in the Anterior/Posterior direction (see Figure 4 ??). \ac{TR}/\ac{TE} should not be changed. \\
