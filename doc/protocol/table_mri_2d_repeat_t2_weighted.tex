Further explanations   & Please instruct the participant to keep their eyes open during the entire scan. You can instruct them to focus on a point on the mirror or scanner. Check with the participant immediately after the scan to verify they kept their eyes open and did not fall asleep. No audio or video presentation should be made during the scan. \\
