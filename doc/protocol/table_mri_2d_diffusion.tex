Further explanations & Please instruct the participant to keep still
                       during the entire scan. \ac{DTI} should be
                       acquired with 32 directions. Slices should
                       cover top of the brain down to base of
                       cerebellum. Two sequences with reversed phase
                       encoding direction should be acquired in full
                       to correct for susceptibility induced
                       distortions. If acquiring a phantom scan, only
                       one sequence with reverse phase encoding
                       direction should be acquired.                                         \\
