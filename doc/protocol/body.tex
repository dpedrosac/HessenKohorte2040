\chapter{Protocol}
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
\ac{PD} represents a chronic neurodegenerative condition manifesting with both motor and non-motor symptoms. The disabilities in \ac{PD} have a major psychosocial impact and lead to considerable losses in patients' quality of life and a high burden on (informal) caregivers. To date, various instruments have been developed to assess \ac{HRQOL}, some of which are specific to \ac{PD} (Quelle Stuerenberg 2022). Nevertheless, none of the models takes into account the positive aspects of well-being, as well as the personal attitiude (e.g., optimism) and social resilience factors like social support, degree of integration, to name a few. In the context of this project, an investigation of the hollistic quality of life of \ac{PD}-patients will be carried out. For this purpose, life quality will be assessed primarily longitudinally over a longer period of time with established and validated \ac{HRQOL} questionnaires. In a further step, holistic observations of life quality will aim at providing meaningful statements in terms . The envisaged instrument for recording this, the so-called \ac{CHAPO} model, an approach initially developed for evaluating the quality of life of the very old (NRW80+ (Quelle?)). By adapting it to aspects of \ac{PD}-patients, the so called \acs{CHAPO-PD} model (Quelle Thieken et al. 2021) will find application in this cohort study. Thus, the aim of this project is establishing a digital \ac{QoL} monitoring system with the goal of assessing \ac{PD}-patients in a standardised way throughout the course of their disease and to evaluate their quality of life. We would like to relate the data obtained in this way to the annual follow-up cranial \ac{MRI} and the biomedical markers obtained from stool, urine, saliva, hair and blood samples. This would conceivably identify imaging or biomedical markers with predictive value for \ac{QoL}-change. In addition, this longitudinal study will include a follow-up assessment of necessary support services to improve understanding the needs of family members of \ac{PD}-patients. This should make it possible to develop a demand-oriented support offer according to the different phases of the disease. The stress experience, changes in sleep behavior and the losses in quality of life over the observation period are also included in the analysis in order to detect a surrogate for adequate support.

\subsection{Geographic context}
Approximately \SI{400000} people are diagnosed with \ac{PD} in Gernany with an incidence of \SI{84.1} per \SI{100000} patients annually [12]. The \UKGM treates up to 1500 patients. In order to understand the special recruitment peculiarities of the University Hospital of Marburg, the knowledge about the location of Marburg in Germany is essential, because Marburg is situated in the countryside in the western center of Germany with 77,129 inhabitants [18], although it is a university city and district town in Hesse. Due to its location about 77 kilometers of direct distance between the metropolitan areas of Frankfurt am Main and Kassel, the importance of the University Hospital of Marburg in the medical care of the district 70 km around Marburg is essential. To ensure patient’s access to care in the district of Marburg, the Parkinson Network Alliance Marburg (PANAMA) was created in 2016 by the Department of Neurology at the Marburg University Hospital. Within this care network different stakeholders work together to facilitate the integration of care services and improve outcomes for patients. 

To represent diversity of the real-life population of PD patients in the district of the Marburg University Hospital, and to guarantee a balanced study cohort, it is intended to include all patients with parkinsonism in the district. Therefore, successfully approved recruitment strategies used in past clinical trials needed to be adopted and refined. First, the patients are directly asked to participate within their appointments in the outpatient clinic or the hospital stay in the Department of Neurology in the University Hospital Marburg. Second, the PANAMA healthcare network will bring the study to the attention of its members, so that the associated healthcare providers will further promote the study. Third, media appearance of the University Hospital will give detailed information (https://www.uni-marburg.de). Additionally, the associated caregivers are requested to participate.

\section{Study objectives and Endpoints}
\section{Study design}
The \textsc{HessenKohorte} Study is a prospective 20-year cohort study. The \textsc{HessenKohorte} study aims to recruit patients of all genders suffering from clinically probable \ac{PD} (n = 1000) along with their relatives in the German region of Hessen. All patients will be recruited from the treated patients in an in- and outpatient setting between 2022 and 2042. 

\subsection{Scale and duration}
The study will accompany up to 1000 patients over as much as 20 years in order to enable a good insight into the course of the individual patients and their relatives.
\subsection{Justification for study design}
This study is a single-center prospective and longitudinal cohort study to monitor \ac{PD}-patients development over the course of the disease and particularly to assess their quality of life in a holistic approach. The comparatively large number of subjects will enable a better insight into \ac{PD} with its multifacetted phenotypes

\section{Subject accountability}

\subsection{Point of enrollment}
A subject will be considered enrolled at the time of the study-specific informed consent form (ICF) execution. No study-related procedures or assessments can take place until the ICF is signed.

\subsection{Withdrawal}
All subjects enrolled in the \textsc{HessenKohorte} (including those withdrawn from the clinical study) shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reasons shall be reported.

Reasons for withdrawal include but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item subject or relative choice to withdraw consent
  \item lost to follow-up
  \item pregnancy*
  \item implantation of electrical devices or metal parts in or on the body *
\end{itemize}

* Only the MR-imaging will be discontinued during pregnancy or from the moment of an implantation onwards.

Subjects may of course withdraw at any time, with or without reason, and without prejudice to further treatment. All applicable case report forms \ac{CRF} up to the point of subject withdrawal and an ``End of Study'' form must be completed. Any subject deemed ``lost to follow-up'' should have a minimum of three documented attempts to contact him/her prior to completion of the ``End of Study'' form. Additional study data may no longer be collected after the point at which a subject has been withdrawn from the study or withdraws consent, for whatever reason. Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used. Subjects withdrawn after completing the implant procedure will not be replaced

\begin{itemize}
\item Part I: Experiences of daily living (non-motor symptoms), including 13 items.
\begin{itemize}
\item A: Behavioral problems of the patient, as evaluated by the examiner.
\item B: Part on non-motor symptoms completed by the patient, with the assistance of a caregiver if necessary, but independent of the investigator.
\end{itemize}
\item Part II: Experiences of daily living (motor aspects) with 13 items. This part is also a self-report questionnaire to be completed by the patient, with the assistance of a caregiver if necessary, but independent of the investigator.
\item Part III: Motor examination with 18 items. All instructions are read to the patient by the examiner or demonstrated directly, so that this part is completed by the examiner.
\item Part IV: Motor Complications with 6 items. This part contains instructions for the examiner and also instructions to be read to the patient. It combines patient-related information with clinical observations and assessments by the examiner.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\acl{MoCa} (\acs{MoCa})}
\acl{MoCa} is a screening tool that can quickly identify hints on cognitive decline according to mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The entire test consists of approximately 10-minutes of questions around different domains of cognitiion. The 30 questions test cognitive abilities such as memory, language production , contextual thinking, attention and concentration, behavior, arithmetic, temporal and spatial orientation, and the ability to recognize complex shapes and patterns. The test is validated is extensively applied in clinical routine. 
% TODO add details from https://www.sralab.org/rehabilitation-measures/montreal-cognitive-assessment

\subsubsection{\acl{NMSQ}, (\acs{NMSQ})}
The \ac{NMSQ} is a 30-item rater-based scale designed to assess a broad
spectrum of non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease
(PD).  (PD). The \ac{NMSQ} measures the severity and frequency of non-motor
symptoms across nine dimensions.

\subsubsection{\acl{BDI} (\acs{BDI})}
The \ac{BDI} is a questionnaire which aims at assessing the severity of depressive symptoms in case depression exists. It is not intended to assess depression per se, but only its severity. Hence, it cannot be used as a screening method in the normal population so taht other alternatives should be contemplated. The applied second version of the \ac{BDI} consists of  21 questions which are supposed to be evaluated for the previous two weeks. 

Scores:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep2pt
\item 0–12: no depressive symptoms or clinically inapparent
\item 13–19: mild depressive syndrome
\item 20–28: moderate depressive syndrome
\item $>$ 29 severe depressive syndrome
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\acl{CBI} (\acs{CBI})}
The \ac{CBI} is a questionnaire for measring personal burnout, work-related burnout, and client-related burnout with a very high internal reliability. It has shown to correlate with future sickness absence, sleep problems, the use of pain-killers, and intention to quit the job. 

\subsubsection{\acl{CISS} (\acs{CISS})}
The \ac{CISS} is an instrument for the assessment of coping style. It assesses three different styles: task-oriented coping, emotion-riented coping and avoidance-oriented coping which in turn can be subdivided into social distraction-oriented coping and more general distraction-oriented coping.

\subsubsection{\acl{MFI-20}}
Fatigue is a state where a person experiences a reduced level of energy in daily life activities. The \ac{MFI-20} is an instrument which measures fatigue via 20 different items on five subscales: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity.

\subsubsection{\acl{PDCB} (\acs{PDCB})}
The \ac{PDCB} is a questionnaire specifically aiming at caregiver burden for caregivers of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It assesses the caregivers burden on the seven subscales of physical burden, sleep disruption, patient symptoms, responsibilities, patient medications, social burden as well as patient and self-relationship. Furthermore a global measure of caregiver burden is given. 

\subsubsection{\acl{PHQ}}
% TODO

\subsubsection{\acl{PSS} (\acs{PSS})}
The perceived stress scale is an instrument for the assessment of the subjective stressfulness of different life events across the last month. A global score is obtained which can be used to subdivide subjects into groups of low stress (0-13 points), moderate stress (14-26points) and high stress (27-40 points).

\subsubsection{\acl{WHOQoL} (\acs{WHOQoL})}
The \ac{WHOQoL} is a detailed, standardized measure of ones Quality of Life (QoL) which is available in many languages and puts an emphasis on cross-cultural comparability. It features 100 questions which can be assessed with six domain scores, 24 \emph{facet} scores as well as a global QoL \emph{facet} score. The domain scores describe QoL on the following dimension: physical, psychological, level of independence, social relationships, environment, and spirituality.

\subsubsection{\acl{ZBI-22} (\acs{ZBI-22})}
The \ac{ZBI-22} is a questionnaire assessing the burden of a caregiver caring for another person on a 22 item scale. It is one of the moust commonly used tools to assess this type of burden. % TODO more ....

\subsection{\ac{MRI}}
Every \ac{PD}-patient will receive MR-imaging if no contraindication exists and at the request of the respective patient. With the aim of producing the greatest possible synergistic effects with other large studies at the centre and to ensure a high quality of the sequences, the programme to be run was based on the PPMI study (\url{https://www.ppmi-info.org/}). Further details are disclosed below.

\subsubsection{Procedure of the imaging}
% Werden NUR die Patienten gemessen oder auch die Angehörigen?
Participants should be positioned comfortably and correctly to minimize motion during the scan. Furthermore, technicians will be instructed to comply with the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Participant should be informed about the total acquisition time and positioned for maximum comfort.
\item Subjects must be positioned comfortably and supine in the head coil to minimize any motion during the scan.
\item Proper back support, and support under the knees will ensure greater comfort, and lead to less motion in the scan.
\item There should be no left-right or ear-to-shoulder head tilt, and the participant’s neck should not be hyper- extended or retracted.
\item Subject's head should be centered in the head coil using the nasion (see example to the right) as an anatomical landmark. Ensure the participant is high enough in the coil to avoid loss of signal at the inferior aspects of the brain.
\item Immobilization devices, such as velcro straps, or foam padding should be used to reduce motion.
\item The positioning lasers should be used to send the nasion to the magnets isocenter.
\end{itemize}
If a participant’s neck length is such that it does not permit proper positioning in the head coil, please document this on the \ac{MRI} Acquisition Document along with any other pertinent information regarding the participants scanning session.

To avoid artifacts, position the participant such that there is sufficient empty space around the head: approximately 1.5 cm of air or more above the top of the head, and leave 3 - 4 blank slices on either side of the head. Avoid nose ghosting.\\

The slices should be centered in the axial plane to prevent aliasing in the Anterior/Posterior direction (see Figure 4 ??). \ac{TR}/\ac{TE} should not be changed. \\
